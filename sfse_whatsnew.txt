0.2.17
- support for 1.15.222

0.2.16
- support for 1.15.216
- compiler setting changes in the most recent game patch have changed the code enough to invalidate the Address Library and most if not all existing plugins. plugins using the Address Library must flag themselves as using version 2 in their compatibility data (see PluginAPI.h)

0.2.16
- support for 1.14.74

0.2.15
- fixed sign check compatibility

0.2.14
- in order to reduce virus scanner false positives, the SFSE components now use a code signature. no, plugins will not need signing.
- removed some unused command line options (mostly ignored rather than removed to reduce end user breakage)

0.2.13
- support for 1.14.70
- note that major changes have been made to the root game form class, so many older plugins will need to be recompiled to work with game version 1.14.70. this is not an SFSE change, Bethesda updated the game code.

0.2.12
- disabled preliminary serialization API (stability issues to be resolved later)

0.2.6
- the loader has been made version-independent due to continued problems with false positives. it should not need to be updated. this means that we lose out on a bit of diagnostic information (the loader no longer knows the latest version of the game). feel free to blame microsoft for this.

0.2.0
- plugin compatibility flag update for the breaking changes in 1.8.86
