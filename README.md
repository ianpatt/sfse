![testbuild](https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse/workflows/testbuild/badge.svg)

## Building

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse
cmake -B sfse/build -S sfse
cmake --build sfse/build --config Release
```

## Runtime Support

The Starfield Script Extender (SFSE) supports the latest version of Starfield on Steam. The Microsoft Store/GamePass version is not supported. No, making it so you can see the files doesn't solve the problem.
